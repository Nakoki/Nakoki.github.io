            <h1>What is TFT?</h1>
            <p class="info">Teamfight Tactics is an autobattler: a round-based PvP game where you'll 
                draft a team that battles automatically on your behalf. If you've never 
                played an autobattler before, don't worry! TFT borrows from many of the 
                concepts you know and love about other strategy games, like drafting from 
                a shared pool of resources, team building, economy management, and positioning.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="info">Here's how it works: Individuals face off in 1-on-1 matches until only one player remains.
                You win by drafting the best team of champions from a shared pool, equipping them with powerful
                items, managing your gold income to buy out the competition, and positioning your team in winning
                battle formations. There are unlimited winning strategies, so you'll have to adapt to different situations
                in every game to come out on top.</p>

            <h1>Sets</h1>
            <p class="info">Every game of TFT takes place in the Convergence, and centers around a specific
                theme and story called a set. Every few months TFT introduces you to a new universe
                with new champions, traits, and characters to play. In terms of gameplay, new sets
                also come with a new Ranked ladder to climb, new team compositions, and new item possibilities.</p>
            <p class="info">Currently the game is having it's 13th set: Into The Arcane. Based on the Arcane Netflix Series.</p>
